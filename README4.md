Build a web application in Python with PywebIO
=============================================

Writing pseudo code and flowcharts
-----------------------------------

Brainstorm and plan code before you write it. 
Writing logic and steps of your code in plain English before puttng it into the syntax of python.

Advantages:
- easy to write and figure out logic of problem
- don't run into errors later
- saves time
- easy to communicate to others with no coding knowledge

Use keywords to describe the control structures that would be used in Python 

- print or display
- get
- divide
- save
- set
- store
- input

flowcharts:
- Use rounded square to indicate start and end, 
- use paralellagram to indicate input or output statement
- use diamond to indicate conditional
- use rectangle to indicate operation

pseudo code:
enter a start and exit statement
comment each section - add comments for:
- input section
- processing section
- output section

BMI app example pseudo code
---------------------------
# input
Get height and weight

# processing
set BMI as weight divided by (height divided by 100) **2
set top statuses

# output
for top statuses 
if BMI is less than or equal to top status then print HTML results
